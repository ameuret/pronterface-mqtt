## Pronterface Status â†’ MQTT

A daemon that reads the status of a Pronterface instance, using its XMLRPC interface, and publishes it to an MQTT Broker.

It is intended to be used in a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) environment but can obviously be used anywhere an MQTT Broker is reachable.
